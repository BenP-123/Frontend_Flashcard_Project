Project: Flashcard-o-matic
A local school has decided to put together a flashcard application, Flashcard-o-matic, to help their students study online. Teachers will use this application to create decks of flashcards for the subjects they teach, and students will study the decks. The school needs you to build the application that the students and teachers will use.

Project setup
Follow the instructions below to get this project up and running on your own machine:

Run npm install to install the project.

To run the tests, you can run the following command:

npm test
Most of the tests in this project wait for content to load via the API before continuing the test. Before the implementation is complete, the content never loads so the test fails with a timeout. As a result, the tests will initially run slowly. It may take perhaps a minute or more for all the tests run. The tests will speed up as the implementation nears completion.

You can run the application using the following command.

npm start
The start command will start two servers concurrently:

An API server, powered by json-server, running on http://localhost:5000
A React application running on http://localhost:3000
To stop the servers from running, you can press Control+C.

Running on Windows
If you are having problems running npm start on Windows, you may need to run the React client and server in separate terminals. Open a terminal and run npm run start:react to start the react application. Open another terminal and run npm run start:server to run the server.

Instructions
You are tasked with building a number of different screens for the users of the flashcard app, as summarized below:

Screen	Path	Description
Home	/	Shows a list of decks with options to create, study, view, or delete a deck
Study	/decks/:deckId/study	Allows the user to study the cards from a specified deck
Create Deck	/decks/new	Allows the user to create a new deck
Deck	/decks/:deckId	Shows all of the information about a specified deck with options to edit or add cards to the deck, navigate to the study screen, or delete the deck
Edit Deck	/decks/:deckId/edit	Allows the user to modify information on an existing deck
Add Card	/decks/:deckId/cards/new	Allows the user to add a new card to an existing deck
Edit Card	/decks/:deckId/cards/:cardId/edit	Allows the user to modify information on an existing card
All of the screens above will work on two common datasets. The datasets are related, and at times, you will need to work with both datasets to get the screens to work properly.

While working on these screens, you have both the tests and the screenshots below to act as a guide. You can create the screens in any order and are encouraged to organize your code using the grouping-by-route technique you learned earlier.

While working on this project, you should:

Use well-named variables.
Build small, single-responsibility components and functions.
Display a "Not found" message if the user visits a URL that does not exist.
Edit only files inside of the public/src/ directory.
While working on this project, you should not:

Change the names of the API functions.
Edit any of the files outside of the public/src/ directory.
Change the location of any of the existing files.
If you feel as though one of your solutions is working, but something isn't showing up right on the site or in the tests, reach out for help.

API
There are two datasets that are a part of this project: decks and cards.

You can view all the data inside of the data/db.json file. Each data set can be accessed via a named property in this file. The following is a partial listing of the data in data/db.json:

{
  "decks": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "...",
      "description": "..."
    }
  ],
  "cards": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "front": "...",
      "back": "...",
      "deckId": 1
    }
  ]
}
Decks
Each Deck is an object with the following shape:

{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Rendering in React",
  "description": "React's component structure allows for quickly building a complex web application that relies on DOM manipulation. "
}
A Deck represents a collection of flashcards, or simply cards.

Cards
Each card is an object with the following shape:

{
  "id": 1,
  "front": "Differentiate between Real DOM and Virtual DOM.",
  "back": "Virtual DOM updates are faster but do not directly update the HTML",
  "deckId": 1
}
Each card represents a flashcard with a front , where the question is displayed, and a back, where the answer can be found. A card also contains the deckId, which matches the card to the deck that the card belongs to.

Utility functions
There are several utility functions exported from src/utils/api/index.js that allow you to perform create, read, update, and delete operations with the API server. You will need to select and use the appropriate functions in your React components.

Note that the updateDeck(), readDeck(), and listDecks() functions call the API server using URLs that include a query string of _embed=cards. The results of the API calls for these functions will contain both the deck and the cards associated with the deck, so you won't have to make additional API calls to load the cards for each deck when you use these functions.

Please read the documentation in the file for more information.

Screens
You are tasked with creating the following screens that work with the above datasets.

Home
The Home screen is the first page the user sees. It is displayed at /.

Home screen

The Home screen has the following features:

The path to this screen should be /.
A Create Deck button is shown, and clicking it brings the user to the Create Deck screen.
Existing decks are each shown with the deck name, the number of cards, and a Study, View, and Delete button.
Clicking the Study button brings the user to the Study screen.
Clicking the View button brings the user to the Deck screen.
Clicking the Delete button shows a warning message before deleting the deck.
Delete Deck prompt
When the user clicks the Delete button, a warning message is shown and the user can click OK or Cancel. If the user clicks OK, the deck is deleted and the deleted deck is no longer visible on the Home screen.

You can use window.confirm() to create the modal dialog shown in the screenshot below.

Delete Deck prompt

Study
The Study screen is displayed at /decks/:deckId/study.

Study first card

The Study screen has the following features:

The path to this screen should include the deckId (i.e., /decks/:deckId/study).
You must use the readDeck() function from src/utils/api/index.js to load the deck that is being studied.
There is a breadcrumb navigation bar with links to home /, followed by the name of the deck being studied, and finally the text Study (e.g., Home/Rendering In React/Study).
The deck title (i.e., "Study: Rendering in React" ) is shown on the screen.
Cards are shown one at a time, front-side first.
A button at the bottom of each card "flips" it to the other side.
After flipping the card, the screen shows a Next button (see the Next button section below) to continue to the next card.
After the final card in the deck has been shown, a message (see the Restart prompt section below) is shown offering the user the opportunity to restart the deck.
If the user does not restart the deck, they should return to the home screen.
Studying a deck with two or fewer cards should display a "Not enough cards" message (see the "Not enough cards" section below) and a button to add cards to the deck.
Next button
The Next button appears after the card is flipped.

Study after first card is flipped

Restart prompt
When all cards are finished, a message is shown and the user is offered the opportunity to restart the deck. If the user does not restart the deck, they return to the home screen.

You can use window.confirm() to create the modal dialog shown in the screenshot below.
